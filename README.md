in assigment.html part  1. `!DOCTYPE html: This declaration specifies that the document type is HTML5.

2. `html lang="en"`: The `html` tag represents the root element of the HTML document. The `lang` attribute is used to indicate the language of the content, and in this case, it's set to "en" for English.

3. `head`: The `head` element contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the title of the page.

4. `meta charset="UTF-8"`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document, which is set to "UTF-8" to support a wide range of characters from different languages.

5. `meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"`: This meta tag sets the viewport properties for responsive design. It ensures that the webpage adapts to the screen width of the device and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0.

6. `title Test /titl`: The `<title>` tag is used to define the title of the HTML document that appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

7. `bod`: The `body` element contains the visible content of the webpage.

8. `pProject 1-Resume /p`: This creates a paragraph containing the title "Project 1-Resume."

9. `hr`: The `hr` tag represents a thematic break or a horizontal rule. It creates a horizontal line to separate content sections.

10. `
11. `a href="URL" target="rightpanle": The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink, and the `href` attribute specifies the URL of the linked page. The `target` attribute sets the target window or frame where the linked page should open. In this case, it's set to "rightpanle."

12. `img src="URL" width="100%" height="150px" alt="description">`: The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in the webpage. The `src` attribute specifies the image URL. The `width` and `height` attributes set the image dimensions, and the `alt` attribute provides a text description of the image for accessibility purposes.

13. `/a`: This closing tag ends the hyperlink created by the `a` tag.

14. `br`: The `br` tag inserts a line break, creating a vertical space between elements.

15. The code repeats steps 8 to 13 multiple times, creating sections for each project with different titles, images, and links.

16. `/body`: This closing tag ends the content of the webpage.

in index.html  
  1   iframe src="./assignment.html" width="20%" height="640vh"  iframe:

The first iframe is used to embed a local web document with the filename "assignment.html" into the current webpage.
The src attribute specifies the path to the document to be embedded, which is "./assignment.html" in this case. The "./" at the beginning indicates that the file is in the same directory as the current HTML document.
The width attribute sets the width of the iframe to 20% of the width of the container (presumably the window or the parent element).
The height attribute sets the height of the iframe to a fixed value of 640 viewport height units (vh). Using "vh" as a unit means that the height will be equal to 640% of the viewport height, which makes the iframe take up most of the vertical space in the view.
iframe src="https://ayush19bansal.github.io/Resume_Assignment/" width="79%" height="640vh" name="rightpanle" /iframe

The second iframe is used to embed a web document hosted at the URL "https://ayush19bansal.github.io/Resume_Assignment/" into the current webpage.
The src attribute specifies the URL of the external document to be embedded.
The width attribute sets the width of the iframe to 79% of the width of the container (presumably the window or the parent element).
The height attribute is set to a fixed value of 640 viewport height units (vh), just like the first <iframe>.
The name attribute sets the name of the iframe to "rightpanle". This is important as it allows targeting this specific iframe when a link is clicked with the target attribute set to "rightpanle". This means that when links with target="rightpanle" are clicked, the linked page will load within this specific iframe.
